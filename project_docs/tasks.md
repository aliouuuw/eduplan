## 🐛 **Known Issues & Bug Fixes** (October 10, 2025)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ 404 error when redirecting to `/dashboard` after login
  - Updated middleware to redirect directly to role-specific dashboard
  - Created catch-all `/dashboard/page.tsx` for proper routing
- ✅ Missing toast notification hook
  - Created `hooks/use-toast.ts` wrapper for Sonner
  - Added toast support across all admin pages
- ✅ **Runtime TypeError in Admin Teachers Page** - Fixed `.map is not a function` error
  - **Root Cause:** API responses return objects with nested arrays (`{users: [...]}`, `{subjects: [...]}`)
  - **Fix:** Updated data fetching to access correct properties (`data.users`, `data.subjects`, `data.classes`)
  - **Impact:** Teachers and subjects now display correctly in assignment dialogs
- ✅ **Database Seeding Issues** - Fixed teacher-class assignment logic
  - **Root Cause:** Incomplete subject assignments, missing level-specific teachers
  - **Fix:** Restructured teacher data with level assignments, ensured ALL classes get ALL required subjects
  - **Impact:** Each class now has complete curriculum with qualified teachers

**Known Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Duplicate Availability Saves** - React Strict Mode causes multiple API calls when dragging to create teacher availability slots
  - **Impact:** Teachers may see multiple overlapping availability slots created
  - **Root Cause:** React Strict Mode double-invokes effects, creating multiple mouseup listeners
  - **Workaround:** Manual cleanup of duplicate slots via UI or database
  - **Status:** Known limitation - does not break core functionality
  - **Severity:** Medium (cosmetic issue, data integrity maintained via database constraints)

**Phase 5.0 Issues - Timetable System:**
- 🔴 **Save Functionality Not Implemented** - CRITICAL
  - **Impact:** Timetable changes are NOT saved to database (placeholder code only)
  - **Location:** `src/app/dashboard/admin/timetables/page.tsx` line 232-254
  - **Status:** Must fix immediately
  - **Severity:** Critical (blocking feature)

- 🔴 **No Teacher Availability Validation** - CRITICAL
  - **Impact:** Can schedule teachers outside their availability windows
  - **Location:** `src/app/api/timetables/route.ts` POST endpoint
  - **Missing:** Check against teacherAvailability table
  - **Status:** Must fix immediately
  - **Severity:** Critical (data integrity)

- 🟠 **Timetable Loading Not Working** - HIGH
  - **Impact:** Existing timetables not displayed when selecting a class
  - **Location:** `fetchTimetable` function not properly mapping API response
  - **Status:** Should fix soon
  - **Severity:** High (poor UX)

- 🟠 **No Time Slot Templates** - HIGH
  - **Impact:** All classes share same time slots (no flexibility)
  - **Missing:** Multiple schedule templates (e.g., Primary vs Secondary)
  - **Example:** Primary: 8:00-12:00 | Secondary: 8:00-17:00
  - **Status:** Should add in Phase 5.1
  - **Severity:** High (limits system flexibility)

- 🟡 **No Visual Conflict Indicators** - MEDIUM
  - **Impact:** Conflicts only shown via toast (poor UX)
  - **Missing:** Red highlights, tooltips, visual warnings
  - **Status:** Nice to have
  - **Severity:** Medium (UX enhancement)

- 🟡 **No Workload Validation** - MEDIUM
  - **Impact:** Teachers can be over/under-scheduled
  - **Missing:** Max hours per day/week checks, subject hour requirements
  - **Status:** Add in Phase 5.2
  - **Severity:** Medium (quality of schedule)

- 🟡 **No Bulk Operations** - MEDIUM
  - **Impact:** Must manually schedule each slot
  - **Missing:** Copy day, clone class schedule, apply to all
  - **Status:** Add in Phase 5.2
  - **Severity:** Medium (efficiency)

**Technical Improvements:**
- ✅ Installed `@radix-ui/react-tabs` for tabbed interfaces
- ✅ Consistent form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- ✅ Proper authorization checks in all API routes
- ✅ Multi-tenant data scoping with `schoolId`
