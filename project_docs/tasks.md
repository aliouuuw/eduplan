## 🐛 **Known Issues & Bug Fixes** (October 10, 2025)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ 404 error when redirecting to `/dashboard` after login
  - Updated middleware to redirect directly to role-specific dashboard
  - Created catch-all `/dashboard/page.tsx` for proper routing
- ✅ Missing toast notification hook
  - Created `hooks/use-toast.ts` wrapper for Sonner
  - Added toast support across all admin pages
- ✅ **Runtime TypeError in Admin Teachers Page** - Fixed `.map is not a function` error
  - **Root Cause:** API responses return objects with nested arrays (`{users: [...]}`, `{subjects: [...]}`)
  - **Fix:** Updated data fetching to access correct properties (`data.users`, `data.subjects`, `data.classes`)
  - **Impact:** Teachers and subjects now display correctly in assignment dialogs
- ✅ **Database Seeding Issues** - Fixed teacher-class assignment logic
  - **Root Cause:** Incomplete subject assignments, missing level-specific teachers
  - **Fix:** Restructured teacher data with level assignments, ensured ALL classes get ALL required subjects
  - **Impact:** Each class now has complete curriculum with qualified teachers

**Known Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Duplicate Availability Saves** - React Strict Mode causes multiple API calls when dragging to create teacher availability slots
  - **Impact:** Teachers may see multiple overlapping availability slots created
  - **Root Cause:** React Strict Mode double-invokes effects, creating multiple mouseup listeners
  - **Workaround:** Manual cleanup of duplicate slots via UI or database
  - **Status:** Known limitation - does not break core functionality
  - **Severity:** Medium (cosmetic issue, data integrity maintained via database constraints)

**Technical Improvements:**
- ✅ Installed `@radix-ui/react-tabs` for tabbed interfaces
- ✅ Consistent form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- ✅ Proper authorization checks in all API routes
- ✅ Multi-tenant data scoping with `schoolId`
